## DESCRIPTION
### Purpose
To assist managers/employers with creating a weekly roster for their small business, to save time by entering a few key details instead of handwriting the entire table.

### Instructions for use:
1. User selects create, enter, display or quit.
2. If the user selects display or quit, the program will produce the current state of the roster then loop back again or exit the program
3. If the user selects edit or enter, they will be prompted to enter either a current employee's name (edit) or a new one (enter).
4. Select which day you want to edit
5. Confirm your choice
6. Enter the employee's starting time
7. Enter the employee's ending time
8. Program stores the information and loops back to begin again.

## BRAINSTORMING
The original idea we were going with was an application aimed at casual or part-time employees.
It's purpose was to give the employee some idea of stability and consistency by doing all the calculation in terms of money earned to date, estimated money earned from upcoming shifts, clearly stated hourly rates, maximum hours permitted to work per week and max hours for one shift. These parameters are valuable information to the employer as well, so we tried to build more functionality into it by creating a class for the employer to view all their employers on a roster layout, with all those key parameters neatly displayed along with the relevant employee. We had planned to calculate most of this off their age and position within the small business, eg 14 year olds are to be paid roughly $14 for a casual hospitality position and can legally work a maximum of 3 hours per shift and up to 12 hours a week during school or 18 hours a week otherwise. This was going to streamline the process for the employer when they employed someone new, they only had to input the employee's name, age and position. 


## Conclusion
However, it was too complicated to create in 2 days for beginner ruby programmers and had to be scrapped. We settled with a rostering app, as it became apparent after the first day that we were not going to be able to implement all the features the app needed to function as planned. This coupled with the fact that we weren't working towards a clear idea meant that it was better to take what we had already coded and repurpose it for something more manageable within the remaining time-frame. A mistake, but something to learn from nonetheless. It was a challenge to create Rostr in a day but we managed to produce something of some value.
